# My Day On Twitter

Originally inspired by @suth's Social Timeline (https://github.com/suth/Social-Timeline/) and making use of his code in places this is a learning project for me. Its purpose is to display Twitter Conversations, free standing Mentions and other content from the current day by making use of the Thinkup (http://thinkupapp.com/) API. It uses http://embed.ly to provide previews of linked content.

## Status
It's currently Alpha in terms of functionality and development; it doesn't write anywhere so it's not going to damage your data. However it's limited in what it actually does currently; conversations and mentions.

## Setup

You'll need to get an Embed.ly key which is free for < 10,000 queries per month.

Make a copy of config.sample.js as config.js and enter your details (URL of Thinkup install, your twitter username and your embed.ly key)

## External Libraries

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Embed.ly](http://embed.ly/)
